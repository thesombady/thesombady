## Hi
I'm just an eager student who enjoys coding. 


- Masters-program in comp. physics
- Working on K (my own scientific language)

Mostly experience in simulation and numerical solutions in Python, Matlab, V. Moderate experience in C++, C#, Javascript, and Go.

Contact me on discord <ins> Aristotes#2364</ins> for inquiries.

# Hi
Welcome to my profile. In my profile you can see what I've been working on, and what types of problems I focus on.

## About myself
My name is Andreas Evensen; I'm a 25 year old male from Sweden who enjoy programming. I'm currently enrolled at Stockholm University, where I'm doing my masters in computational Physics. I graduated from Lund university with a bachelor in physics, where I focused on studies on the computational aspects of physics - my bachelor thesis work was called 'Statstics of a three-level maser' [Bachelor thesis code](../../../Bachelor-Thesis). Other studies I've done are heat-dispersion, motion of planets affected by gravitational pull, and 'slime'-evolution. 

## Langugages
My main languages are V and Python - however I have some background in the following: JS, TS, C, C++, C#, Matlab, Ruby, and Rust.

## Current project
As of right now I'm working on a project called LynX-engine; a game engine written in V. The main purpose of this project is to broaden my knowledge of shaders (GLSL via OpenGL API) and to further my understaing of certain coding aspects. In order to achieve this, the majority of the engine is written from scratch and will include its own math-engine, physics-engine and render-engine. __This project is on hold as of right now, focusing on studies and the project mentioned below__.

I'm also currently developing a programming language suited for scientific computation called _K_. It's a language of which focus on readability and mathematical 'correctness' in terms of numerical approximations and solving various equations. It's supposed to be a tool for creating simulations. If you feel interested in such a language, feel free to contact me and join the team on developing this language to its first version `v0.1.0`.
