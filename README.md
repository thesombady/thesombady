- Hi! My name is Andreas Evensen, also known my @thesombady. I'm currently employed as a highschool teacher in Sweden, teaching subjects such as mathematics, physics and programming. My interest resides in mathematical / physical-programming, i.e simulations of all kinds. Previous works include my bachelor thesis work [Quantum statiscs of a three level maser](../../../Bachelor-Thesis), but simulations for heat-disperation, gravitation of planets and "slime" have been done extensivly.
- My main languages are Python and V. I'm more than familiar within these two languages, but have some background in: JS, TS, C, C++, C#, Matlab, Ruby, and Rust.
- I'm currently working on a side project called LynX-Engine which is a game-engine written in V. The main purpose of this project is to broaden my knowledge of shading - languges (currently implementing GLSL via the OpenGL API). To further deepen my understanding of certain coding aspects "most" of the engine is written from scratch; the engine includes its own math-, physics, and render-engine.
- If have intentions of contacting me, you can do so via my email [andreas.evensen11@gmail.com].
