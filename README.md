- 👋 Hi, I’m @thesombady, also known by my name Andreas Evensen. I'm a teacher at a highschool in Sweden; teaching in subjects such as mathematics, physics and programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical physics and simulations. I have made quantum simulations as well as heat-dispersion simulations, slimesimulations and 2d gravitational simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning numerical programming within js / ts and the V programming language. I am proficient in python, matlab; I have some background in C++ and C aswell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my hobby-project Lysandra & LysandraV. It is a 3d game engine written within python/vlang, with some methods written in js. It is written from scratch, meaning that I intend to implement as few liberaries as possible; liberaries such as : os, PIL, json and a few other are the exceptions. 
- 📫 If you intent to reach me, you can do so via my email, Andreas.evensen11@gmail.com.
